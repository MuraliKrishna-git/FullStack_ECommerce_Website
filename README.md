## Future Scope
- **User Authentication** Adding user login and signup options for storing and viewing their personal details and history of orders. As per my knowledge of now AuthO is best for email authentication practices.
- **Real Payment Integration** - Adding Stripe Payment gateway (if any company asked for a fullstack website) or will do it when I have free time or specifically usefull for my career.
- **Mobile App Version** - This is a big problem on paper, but simple we can do a react app like Amazon ðŸ˜†. Anyways still learning about this and will update soon!

-**Note:** This project is a demo version on how a fullstack may be designed and the UI in this project is not impressive as I focused mainly on the backed integration and working part considering the deadline I had for this project. In future if time permits, will improve the UI and possibly make a React Web Application.
